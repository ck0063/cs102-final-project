/*
THINGS TO CONSIDER
-all user input must be sanatized and validated.
	-this HAS to happen at every single instance of scanf'ing data into the program
		-should probably make a userInput() function to handle this every time

REQUIREMENTS BROKEN DOWN
-Start menu to begin transaction // this should probably be a function
	-Print statement for grocery kiosk: "Welcome to the CS102 Grocery Store Kiosk! Input the number of the task you wish to do. Make your selection now!
	1. Start checkout 2. Look up item" // printf
	-Get user input, must be sanatized // userInput()
	-Interpret user input // if comparison
		-START CHECKOUT PATH
			-Checkout menu // probably also a function. same as above, printf and userInput()
				-Add item // userInput() an item id
					-check item against items array // for loop should do fine. for(i = 0; itemID != array[i] && i < arraySize; i++){} something like that. how do you break the value out tho
						-if no match or bad input, tell user and return to checkout menu // printf and recall checkoutMenu()? not really sure, seems like that could go poorly
					-ask how many //printf and userInput()
						-add user-specified amount of item to receipt array // again, for loops are our friends. for(i = 0; i < userInput; i++)
				-Remove item
					-get user input for which item  // userInput() item ID
						-check receipt array // for(i = 0; itemID != array[i] && i < arraySize; i++)
				-Continue to payment
				-quit (returns to start menu)
		-ITEM LOOKUP PATH
